# DDD

---

DDD is a software development approach that focuses on the domain model and the domain logic. It is a way to structure
your code in a way that is more maintainable and easier to understand.

The aim is to bring business language and concepts into the codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.

If the business calls Users `Customers` then the code should also call them `Customers`.

Classes and objects should be named after the business concepts they represent.
