# YAGNI

---

YAGNI stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It." It is a principle in software development that suggests you should only
implement features when you actually need them, rather than trying to anticipate future requirements.

### Key Points of YAGNI

- **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Don't add functionality or features until they are needed.
- **Focus on Current Requirements:** Implement only what is necessary to meet the current specifications.
- **Simplicity Over Complexity:** Keep the codebase simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Refactor When Necessary:** If new requirements arise, refactor the code to accommodate them.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization:** Optimize code only when performance issues are identified.
- **Iterative Development:** Embrace an iterative approach to development, adding features incrementally.
- **Avoid Speculative Development:** Don't build features based on speculation or hypothetical future needs.
- **Maintainable Code:** YAGNI helps keep the codebase maintainable by reducing unnecessary complexity.
