# A/B Testing

---

This method is similar to canary deployment, but it involves rolling out the new version to a small percentage of users
and comparing it with the previous version. This way, you can test the new version in production and compare it with the
previous version to see which one performs better.

The challenge with this method is you need to understand how to measure the performance of the new version and compare it
with the previous version. You need to define your success criteria and ensure this is the important metric you use. You
also need to understand what timeframe you want to measure the change and when to increase the percentage.

A/B Testing is a great tactic when you want to make sure that your change is positively impacting your users. It's also
a great way to test new features and see how they perform in the real world. For example if your team had an idea for a
new feature but the customers didn't like the new feature, you can easily roll back to the previous version.
