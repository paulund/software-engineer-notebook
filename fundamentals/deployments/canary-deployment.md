# Canary Deployment

---

This method is similar to blue/green deployment, but it involves rolling out the new version to a small percentage of
users. This way, you can test the new version in production without affecting all users. If the new version has any
issues, you can easily roll back to the previous version.

The challenge with this method is that it requires a lot of automation to roll out the new version to a small percentage
of users and gradually increase it. However, if you want to test the new version in production without affecting all
users, this is the best strategy to choose.
