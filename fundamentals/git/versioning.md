# Versioning

---

When working on a project it's important to define how you are going to version your project.

*SemVer* is a versioning system that is used to communicate upgrades with your applications.

It works with 3 categories
- Major - v1.0.0
- Minor - v1.1.0
- Patches - v1.1.1

Major versions will contain breaking changes that requires the users upgrade their code. You could also use this for a major change,
so that you can communicate to the users that this is a big change.

Minor versions will contain new features that are backwards compatible with the previous version. This is a good way to communicate
to the users that there are new features available.

Patch versions will contain bug fixes that are backwards compatible with the previous version.
