# Create A Brag Document

After reading this article by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/), who makes a case to create my own brag
document.

A brag document is a document where you write down all the things you've accomplished at work. It's a great
way to keep track of your accomplishments and to remind yourself of all the awesome things you've done.

If you do great work people don't always notice, and it's easy to forget about all the awesome things you've done. A brag
document is a great way to keep track of all the things you've done and to remind yourself of everything you have done.

## You Don't Remember Everything You Do

If you don't remember everything you do why would you expect your manager to remember everything you do?

The brag document is a great way of keeping track of all the things you've done, you can also use this document
when discussing your performance with your manager. If you can show all of the things you have done and the impact on
the business then this will help with your case for promotions or pay rises.

## What To Include

- Projects you've worked on
- Problems you've solved
- Business impact
  - If there's a small feature that has made a big impact to the business then include it
- Things you've learned
- Things you've taught others

## Remember To Keep It Updated

Remember to come back to the document often, once a month, every 2 weeks, or even weekly. This will help you remember
all the things you've done and keep the document up to date.
