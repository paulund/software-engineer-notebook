# Github Profile

A Github profile is a great way to showcase your work and skills to potential employers. You can show off
your projects, contributions to open source, and your coding style. As a software engineer, it's a way of showcasing
your coding skills. As Designers have portfolios to showcase their work, software engineers should have Github profiles.

Github has a default repository that is named the same as your user name, this repository is your profile repository, which
