# Linkedin Profile

Once you have created your [CV](/career/finding-work/cv) you should also create a Linkedin profile. Linkedin is a
professional social network that is used by recruiters and employers to find candidates. You can use Linkedin to
showcase your skills and experience to potential employers.

You'll find that it's very common for employers and recruiters to use your Linkedin profile to find out more about you
and to contact you on there to discuss any job opportunities.

Make sure that you've got a professional photo on your Linkedin profile. This means no selfies, no photos of you on
holiday, and no photos of you with other people. You should have a photo of just you, in professional attire.

## Employment History

You should list your employment history on your Linkedin profile. This should include your job title, the company you
worked for, and the dates that you worked there. You should also include a short description of the company and your
responsibilities.

You can also include any achievements that you had in the role. This could be projects that you worked on, targets that
you hit, or any awards that you won.

## Skills

Listing your skills on your Linkedin profile is a great way to showcase your abilities to potential employers. You can
list your skills in a table or as a list. You can use this skill list in Linkedin to search for new job opportunities,
using these skills.

## Recommendations

You can ask your colleagues and managers to write recommendations for you on Linkedin. This is a great way to show
potential employers that you are a great employee. You can also write recommendations for your colleagues and managers.

## Premium Account

Having a premium account on Linkedin can be beneficial. You can see who has viewed your profile, you can see how you
compare to other candidates, and you can send messages to people that you're not connected with.

This is very useful when you are looking for a new job as you can contact recruiters directly.

There is a lot of competition for jobs on Linkedin, some software jobs can have 100s/1000s of applicants within the first
few days of being listed. This is far too many for any recruiter to look through so they will use filters to reduce the
number of applicants. A good way of standing out to the recruiter is by sending them a direct message to show your interest
in the role.

This way you can send your CV directly to them rather than being in a pile of 100s of other CVs applying for the same role.
